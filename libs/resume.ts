// Resuming a run: a class an earlier run already passed every gate for is not written again.
//
// A folder target runs one batch per class, and a batch is several writer and reviewer sessions and
// builds — minutes to half an hour each. A run cut short at its twentieth class (a terminal that
// hung up, a laptop that went to sleep, a build that ran out of memory), or one that ended with
// three classes failed, started over from the first class when run again: hours of passes redone,
// the writer told to "improve" tests that had just passed every gate.
//
// Each passed batch now leaves a record of what it passed with (passed.json in its run's artifacts):
// every class's source and its test files, hashed. A later run skips a class only when that record
// still describes the tree exactly, and only after checking again what can be checked again:
//
// - Build: this run's baseline built the module and ran the class's tests — green. A baseline that
//   is red (UT_ALLOW_DIRTY_BASELINE) or skipped proves nothing, and nothing is skipped then.
// - Coverage: measured again from that build's own JaCoCo report, at today's thresholds. Other tests
//   and the classes it calls change what a test covers without touching either file.
// - Review: not run again — a reviewer session is what a skip saves. Its verdict holds for exactly
//   what it read, the class and its test files under the rubric, and nothing else: all three are
//   compared, and the scores are judged again at today's thresholds (gates/review.ts parseVerdict).
//
// Pure except for the file reads and the one write; the gate checks are loop.ts's.
